Annotations:
	rabbit:Purpose "To describe soil properties and processes, as well as their relationships.",
	rabbit:Scope "The ontology mainly describes soil physical properties and processes, as well as how they affect each other.",
	rabbit:KnowledgeSource "The knowledge sources of this ontology include:

- knowledge explained in the textbook: Principles of Soil Physics, by Rattan Lal and Manoj K. Shukla, 2004.

- knowledge of domain experts

- The SWEET ontology (https://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov)

- online dictionaries: Oxford Dictionary (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com) and Cambridge Dictionary (http://dictionary.cambridge.org)

For the relation statements (OWL logical axioms) in the ontology, we add annotations to indicate their knowledge sources. If a statement is based on knowledge explained in the textbook, we provide page numbers, table names, figure names, chapter or section names to help users locate its explanations.

The file Soil-Property-Process.owl is created manually. Opening the file using a text editor, one can find the annotations of a relation statement easily.",
