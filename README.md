# RBC-AI-Knowledge-Graph
The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has taken action to help Canadian farmers enhance production yield, optimize natural resources, combat climate change, and lead The Next Green Revolution. Through surveys and interviews, it is highlighted that making decisions on irrigation timing is one of the biggest challenges for the farmers. The consequences of excessive or insufficient irrigation negatively impact plant health and crop yields. To address this, there is a need to analyze the relationships between crop yield, farm characteristics, soil properties, and weather conditions. We proposed the Flamel Ontology by integrating structures from existing ontologies, and importing the data from Climate Data and farms. The design successfully models intricate relationships in between weather conditions, soil moisture, and their impact on farms and fields. The knowledge graph is written in OWL2 and evaluated using the automatic reasoner (ELK 0.5.0) and SPARQL queries. The success of the design paves the way for future research applications in the realm of digital twin technology. By providing valuable insights into the complex interplay of agricultural factors, our design contributes to promoting sustainable and efficient farming practices, benefiting both the agricultural sector and the broader society
